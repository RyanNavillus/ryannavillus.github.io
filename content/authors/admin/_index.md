I'm a 5th year PhD candidate at the University of Maryland studying reinforcement learning in open-ended environments. My research centers around developing an empirical understanding of policy gradient algorithms and automatic curriculum learning methods. I was one of the developers of PettingZoo for multiagent environments and have worked on a number of open source tools for RL, including my curriculum learning library {{< staticref "https://github.com/RyanNavillus/Syllabus" "newtab" >}}Syllabus{{< /staticref >}}. I've interned at Amazon Science, Google Research, and Sony AI working on RL and RLHF. I'm very interested in research directions that use LLMs to augment RL training in complex environments, or RL to improve the general capabilities of LLMs. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss ideas or opportunities to collaborate! I'm looking for industry research scientist or postdoc positions starting in August 2025.
